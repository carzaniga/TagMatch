This software is part of the Siena Content-Based Networking System.
In particular, this software targets TagNet, a content-based network
in which content descriptors consist of sets of tags.

This package contains a number of prototypes and experimental software
for the implementation of the forwarding module for TagNet.  The
forwarding tables and matching algorithms are for a routing scheme
built on mutiple spanning trees.

This package contains the following programs:

 - gen: workload generator with application-specific tags

 - gen2: more versatile ad generic workload generator

 - router: RIBs and corresponding update algorithms

 - cpu_gpu_matcher: two-stage subset matcher

 - test_matcher: simple, sequential matcher 

 - split_prefixes: workload partitioning program

 - analyze_workload: computes frequency table
