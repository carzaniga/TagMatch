This is TagMatch, a hybrid CPU/GPU subset stream matching system.
TagMatch stores a large tables of sets (e.g., sets of string tags)
intended to describe information, each associated with a set of keys
representing identifiers or locators of "subscribers" interested in
information matching the tag set.

TagMatch processes a stream of incoming sets, called "queries".  For
each query Q, TagMatch finds all the keys associated with sets S that
are subsets of Q.

TagMatch can be used as a matching engine for publish/subscribe
systems or more generally as a high-level classification engine in a
stream processing system.

TagMatch is designed to scale to sustain a high-throughput input
stream with very large tables of tag sets.
